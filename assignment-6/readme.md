# Assignment 6 Tech Report
### By Conor Jones
* I chose a couple 1970s graphic for this project (1970s-04 and 1970s-02).  I tried to keep with the theme of orange, yellow and white to emphasis the times of the 70s.  The other graphics were these colors so I thought I would stay consistent with them.  I also used a .gif of arrows pointing down near the top so the user would scroll down the page.

* As mentioned, I used orange, yellow and off-white for my designs.  Orange and yellow seemed to have been an unusually-popular color palette during this time period.

* Along with course material I also researched how to code with CSS online.  *W3 schools* was a nice help.  It shows examples to better understand what to do.  Also, help from my roommate and Prof. Evans was great too!

* My work process was similar to that of prior assignments:
*Learn > Do > Re-learn > Fail > Learn > Succeed!*
