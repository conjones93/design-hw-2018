# Project 3 _Tech Report_

* Padding, margin and borders are all very similar.  To that of a Russian doll, these 3 components work within themselves.  Padding is the space inside of the margin while the border encapsulates the padding and margin.

* The hardest thing about this assignment was the attention to detail it took to properly place correct elements in correct spaces.
    * ie) making sure to close out elements.

* My work cycle for this assignment was founded on use Justine's example as my template.  From there I knew the design I needed to create.  I then went back to lecture material and tools online for guidance.
