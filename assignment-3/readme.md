# Conor's Tech Report

A page can have 3 main headings (used for headings and titles which appear bigger than body and paragraph text) and 1 main body element(s), which is used to designate the central piece of the page.
head is used for titles while body is used for sentences and paragraphs.
Semantic markup declares the meaning for tags for webpages.  Structural markup gives certain info to the webpage so the content is structured and layed out properly.
