 # Assignment 4 Tech Report

My experience learning html started with very basic things in Myspace with creating profiles.  And now, coming back to it and exploring much more - It has been very interesting but also stressful.  I am not the technician type, but more creative.  I find it difficult to make sure that the structure and grammar per specific codes is correct.  HTML is kind of like learning algebra and a new language!

I am anxious and excited to learn how to decorate sites and use CSS.  I have learned a lot about it but haven't delved into it much.  I have worked with sites like wix to make my own site, but haven't learned about the backbone supporting it all.

Problems I ran into were with pushing my folders and files to Github.com through my desktop.  Through trial and error, and help from a friend I was able to get past the issue.
I don't think there is anything I necessarily want to learn more of, but to practice more of what we have already learned.
