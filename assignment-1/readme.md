## My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
### _by Conor Jones_

I've decided to take this class for the following reasons:

* I can use the credits for my BA in Media Arts
* I have been interested in pursuing coding and more of the "tech" side of things rather than aesthetics and the arts.
* I believe that learning this field may help to open up more opportunities and possibilities for my future.

Here are some things that I've learned about the web:
* The web is different than the internet.  The web is basically a platform for the internet to work . . . Likewise as to the earth for a conduit.
* A couple guys by the names of Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau invented the World Wide Web.
* Another fact that blew my mind is that it is not owned by anyone - but rather, either nobody or everyone.
